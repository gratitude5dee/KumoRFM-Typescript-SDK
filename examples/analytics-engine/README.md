# Hyper-Personalized E-commerce Analytics Engine (Example Monorepo)

This example monorepo demonstrates:
- A core TypeScript SDK (src/)
- Supabase Edge Functions backend (supabase/)
- A demo Shopify App (shopify-app/)

Phase 1 (SDK) implemented here; phases 2-3 include minimal stubs to illustrate structure. Use the main repoâ€™s root shopify-app/ for full stubs.
